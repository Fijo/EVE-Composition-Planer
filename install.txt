for devs:
	required tools:
	- Dot Net Framework 2.0+ or Mono 2.0+
	- Node.js (and npm) *
	- PHP *
	- Composer *
	* = you have to configure the right pathes for your environment in ./build/properties/local.build

for deploying it to a server:
	required tools:
	- webserver (apache with mod rewite etc.) with php
	- mysql

	setup guide:
	1. execute setup.bat/ execute the content of it with mono
	2. create an empty mysql database named 'ecp'
	3. import the script ./dbscripts/ECP/ecp.sql
	4. download https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql-latest.tar.bz2 and import that into as a new database called eveonline.
	5. copy the content the public directory into the public root of your webserver.


setting up a server:
// apache config change
-> make sure you have 'AllowOverride All' set for your www root
-> make sure the files in the www root are owned by the apache user (usualy www-data in ubuntu)

// mysql config change
-> make sure lower_case_table_names is set to 1 (before(!) you start importing any sql scripts)


// you need to create 2 databases (ecp and eveonline)

// - that should be at least somewhat like to how you can import the eveonline database

wget https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql-latest.tar.bz2
tar jxvf mysql-latest.tar.bz2
cd galatea-1.114618/
mysql -u root -p eveonline < mysql56-galatea-1.114618.sql

// import data into the ecp database 
mysql -u root -p ecp < dbscripts/ECP/ecp.sql





this is a early version/ guide/ tool might not work entirely yet.
