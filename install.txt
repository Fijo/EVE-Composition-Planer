for devs:
	required tools:
	- Dot Net Framework 2.0+ or Mono 2.0+
	- Node.js (and npm) *
	- PHP *
	- Composer *
	- Chrome (for the testrunner - or some other browser you just have to change the configuration then)
	* = you have to configure the right pathes for your environment in ./build/properties/local.build

for deploying it to a server:
	required tools:
	- webserver (apache with mod rewite etc.) with php
	- mysql
	- cronjob support

	setup guide:
	1. execute setup.bat/ execute the content of it with mono
	2. create an empty mysql database named 'ecp'
	3. import the script ./dbscripts/ECP/ecp.sql
	4. download https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql-latest.tar.bz2 and import that into as a new database called eveonline.
	5. copy the content the public directory into the public root of your webserver.


setting up a server:
// apache config change (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf in ubuntu)
-> make sure you have 'AllowOverride All' set for your www root
-> make sure the files in the www root are owned by the apache user (usualy www-data in ubuntu)

// mysql config change

(do all those adjustments before(!) you start importing any sql scripts)
-> make sure lower_case_table_names is set to 1
-> make sure sql_mode is set to none (search for "sql_mode" if you find a line with that put a # in from of it coment out the line.)
-> make sure innodb_strict_mode is set to 0 (turned off)
	Under the [mysqld] section look for innodb_strict_mode.
	If you find a line where its set change it so it matches the folowing line if you dont just add this one.
	innodb_strict_mode = 0

-> it helps if you increase some of the mysql settings if you dont have ram issues (even if you only have like 500mb ram)
-> table_open_cache        = 195
-> table_definition_cache  = 256


// you need to have php setup with mail support


// you need to create 2 databases (ecp and eveonline)

// - that should be at least somewhat like to how you can import the eveonline database

wget https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql-latest.tar.bz2
tar jxvf mysql-latest.tar.bz2
cd galatea-1.114618/
mysql -u root -p eveonline < mysql56-galatea-1.114618.sql

// import data into the ecp database 
mysql -u root -p ecp < dbscripts/ECP/*.sql (sorted by name in alphabetical order)


// please setup a cronjob that runs php -f jobs.php calculateItemFilterType from the directory ./public/rest as the user your webserver is running under every hour.
if you are using linux you can use the script in ./scripts/install-cron.sh to do so (asuming your webserver is running as the user www-data - which is standard in ubuntu 14.04 and your www root directory is /var/www/html/)


you also might have to adjust the database password/ host in ./public/rest/config/propel.json

to prepare your checked out git repository for a deployment you have to run (.sh or .bat depending on the system you are trying to run in on)
setup
update-propel

to deploy the project you need to copy the content of the public folder into your www root directory.
After doing that you need to fix the rights
chown -R [webserver user] [www root directory]


this is a early version/ guide/ tool might not work entirely yet.
